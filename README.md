# React Boilerplate using Styled Components Design System

This is a boilerplate for React projects using styled-components and a design system. It is based on the [styled-components design system](https://styled-components.com/docs/tooling#design-systems) documentation. It also includes Prettier, Eslint, Storybook, Vitest, and React Testing Library.

With this boilerplate, you can start a new project with a design system and a component library. You can also use the Storybook to document your components and the Vitest to test them. The React Testing Library is also included to test your components.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This boilerplate is only a starting point for your project. You can customize it as you wish.
> - The design tokens must be adjusted for your needs.
